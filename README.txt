This is my repository for learning and trying things with JS. 
Basically I am just having fun here and this is my JS playground.

All games are not at all responsive, I am writing the code on MacBook Pro 13 so for this resolution apps looks fine.
The most important thing here is JS code, not css or html :) 

If you want to play some games feel free to have some fun!
